# Portfolio Review Process

You will be creating, writing, and submitting a portfolio through RevaturePro that showcases yourself, your skills, and your experience. Once completed, your porfolio will be published to our Sales team to share with clients. After you finish creating your portfolio, you will submit it for review. There are two phases for portfolio review:
* Phase 1: due on Wednesday 4 weeks before your training end date
  - Review will complete by that Friday
  - Make any requested changes and start work for Phase 2
* Phase 2: due on Wednesday 5 weeks before your training end date
  - Review will complete by end of day Friday
  - Make any final requested changes you receive and resubmit
* Phase 3: due on Wednesday 6 weeks before your training end date
  - Review will complete by end of day Friday
  - Final deadline to get portfolio published is that Friday
* The specific deadlines will be sent to you via email
* Ask any questions you have to your QC auditor during or after your QC session

The following sections are required to be completed for each phase:
* Phase 1
  - Title
  - About Me
  - Education
  - Other Experiences
* Phase 2
  - Projects (only 1 required)
* Phase 3
  - Skill Matrix
  - Projects (only 1 required)
  
When you submit your portfolio for phase 1, we will review and send any feedback. For phase 2 review, the portfolio should be complete and we will only reject it if there are additional changes that need to be made. All feedback will be given in the rejection email. **Please make sure to check your `revature.net` email for rejection notifications.** If you receive a rejection email, please make the required changes as soon as possible and then resubmit your portfolio.

* Please **DO NOT CLONE** your portfolio, unless asked to do so
  * If you need to make changes, just edit the same portfolio
  * If you have already submitted your portfolio and cannot edit it, ask your QC auditor or trainer to reject it
* Check your revature.net email. If your portfolio is rejected, you will receive an email with comments on changes to be made
* Be aware of submission deadlines for Phase 1 and 2

Additionally, you may upload a professional headshot to your RevaturePro profile. **This is optional**. If you do upload your headshot, it will appear on your portfolio next to your name. Use common sense and follow guidelines for professionalism for any image you upload:
* Your face should be clearly visible and centered in the photo
* You should be wearing professional attire and in a professional environment
* Avoid weird angles, distortions, or other effects
* Smile :)

### About Me
The About Me section should be divided into two sections:
* Background: 1-2 paragraphs (paragraph should be 3-5 full sentences)
  * Describe yourself, your background, make it unique and personal
  * Mention your most important skills and accomplishments you have achieved at a broad, high level
  * Can include talking about your educational experience or any prior work experiences (technical, or non-technical)
* Interesting Facts About Myself
  * This should be in bullet point format
  * 3-5 facts

Use the following template:
> [Intro paragraph - a few sentences]
> 
> [Secondary paragraph - a few sentences]
> 
> **Interesting Facts About Me**
>  * A
>  * B
>  * C
>  * etc...

Your "About Me" section is your chance to stand out to the client. It should be personal, unique, and authentic to who you are. Always keep in mind, though, that everything on your portfolio needs to be **professional**. When writing about yourself, talk about WHO you are, WHAT valuable skills you have, and your WHY - your motivation, passion, drive, and enthusiasm for what you do. WHO you are is simple - start with your title and personal background, and maybe some aspect of your personality. WHAT technical skills you have should be covered briefly and give a high-level overview, as the rest of your portfolio focuses on this.

The WHY portion of your bio often sets you apart. Where does your WHY come from?  We are all products of our upbringing. Our WHY is found by looking back at previous experiences. Growing up, there were times we naturally thrived and did things well. Those natural abilities manifested themselves in different ways and the key to finding your WHY is to identify those experiences and the patterns across them.

Here are some questions to ponder that can help you express your WHY: 

* What is one verb that describes you well? What adjective(s)? 
* Why did you choose a career in technology? 
* What motivates you to do your work? 
* What are your greatest accomplishments? 
* What do you enjoy the most about software development? 
* What are your career goals? 
* I wake up every day inspired to ____ so that _____ 

A good WHY statement has two parts: To __(contribution)__ so that __(impact)__. (But please don't copy this format directly, come up with your own formulation.)

To stand out, **focus not just on your personality or interests, but also on your accomplishments and expertise**. Have you lead a team? Solved a complex problem? Overcome challenging obstacles? Think about how your unique skillset adds value to a potential employer. The more specific you write, the more compelling your bio becomes. Your writing should grab an interviewer's attention and make them want to hire you. Do not be afraid to be proud of yourself and your accomplishments. For a few examples:

#### Example 1
Weak:
> I have learned a little bit about Java and used it on a few projects

Strong:
> I am an accomplished Java full-stack developer with a proven record of building applications to fulfill key business requirements on strict deadlines

#### Example 2
Weak:
> Some technologies I know are Java, SQL, and Spring

Strong:
> I have experience writing object-oriented Java code, constructing complex analytics queries with SQL, and building enterprise-level, production-ready applications with the Spring framework

Below are some examples of what NOT to put in your portfolio:
- Stating that you prefer remote work or that you prefer to work in a particular location
- Information that may be seen as irrelevant or unprofessional
- Details about your personal life or friends or family (use common sense judgement here)
- Don't try to be funny, witty, or use sarcasm (it may be interpreted as unprofessional)

When writing, start with a rough draft but always review and revise it to make it better. Paragraphs should flow well, with smooth transitions. Let's look at a few example sentences and how they can be rewritten to be improved to be clearer, more concise, and direct:

#### Example 1
Poor:
> Since I have worked within a strict military setting, I have the ability to use disclipline and follow in accordance with strict deadlines

Better:
> Because of my military background, I am a discplined goal-setter who can achieve under pressure and meet strict deadlines

#### Example 2
Poor:
> I have always had a very big interest in technology, and I am excited about the process of building full stack applications

Better:
> I have a passion for new technology, so I enjoy using industry-standard tools to create scalable and flexible solutions in an Agile environment

#### Example 3
Poor:
> The frameworks with which I have experience are Spring and Angular for which I have developed different applications that help in easing the development process

Better:
> In my work, I've built apps using popular frameworks for Java and JavaScript, including Spring and Angular, respectively

A final note on writing: as a developer, you may not think of yourself as a writer. You use GUIs and the command line and code to deliver business value - what does writing a portfolio have to do with that and why is it important? In reality, being a developer requires communicating in many ways, including writing. The code you write must be clear, concise, and understandable to others who you are working with. You have to follow the rules of the programming language you use.

Writing about yourself, your projects, or your skills on your portfolio is similar. [Follow correct grammar and spelling](https://www.grammarly.com/), [capitalize appropriately](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-rules/), and make your sentences flow logically together. [Be clear and concise](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/writing-clearly-concisely) - cut out extra fluff just like you would refactor your code to make it simpler and more straightforward. Remember, your portfolio is the first impression that your interviewer will have of you!

### Education & Certifications
-   Fill in your completed degree, Major, University, Month & Year of completion.
-   Fill in your Certification Name, Certification ID, Issued By, Issued On (if any). Upload the Certification Logo/Badge. Add the Public URL to verify your certification.
-   Uncheck '**Show on portfolio**' for email and contact number. 
-   Check '**Show globally**' for all these sections: Education & Certification, Skill Matrix, Work Experience, Other Experience, and Honors & Awards (if you don't do this, it won't show on the published version of the portfolio)

### Skills Matrix

This section provides a list of technologies/skills that you have experience in. Depending on your tech track, you must add **3-5 categories with 5 skills within each category**. The categories should flow well, starting with the skill most relevant to your tech stack. Try to avoid repeating skills across categories. Equivalency number for each skill must be between **3-24 months**. Check your capitalization of each technology or tool. Acronyms like AJAX or ORM should be in all caps, proper nouns like Java should be capitalized, compound words like DevOps should have each word capitalized, and normal words should not be capitalized. If you have a question about it, just google it and check before you submit it!

Below is a table of *suggested* skill categories that you may want to use for your training track:

| Training Track | # Categories Required | Suggested Categories |
|  ------------- | --------------------- | ----- |

### Work Experiences
-   This section is used to mention your work experience with Revature's client after placement.
-   Used mostly for associates coming back from client projects to be re-deployed.
-   As of now, the Work Experiences section should be blank. If you any previous work experience, you can mention them under the Other Experiences section.

### Projects

Each project you complete should be added to this section. Once your trainer assigns the project, it will be available in the drop-down selection. Projects contain a description and a list of technologies used. **You must add your roles and responsibilities on the project by including at least 5 bullet points**. Also, there is a field for your project repository's URL - please do NOT fill this in, as this is not required nor recommended.

These bullet points should talk about how you used different technologies, languages, libraries, tools, frameworks, APIs, etc. Include any metrics you have, like code coverage, code quality grades, build time, lines of code, etc. Also, start your bullet points with the active past tense verbs ("built, created, implemented, etc..."). Do not make your bullet points too short or ramble too long - be concise and specific. Use the below examples to get you started.

#### Example 1
Poor:
> Showed users in the database

Better:
> Used the Collections framework and Stream API to store unique users and filter them by status

#### Example 2
Poor:
> Wrote some tests that tested functionality

Better:
> Added unit tests to validate user inputs in the service layer and increased code coverage from 20% to 70%

#### Example 3
Poor:
> Displayed list of books on the webpage

Better:
> Leveraged Angular's HttpClient service to make async HTTP calls to back-end API to retrieve list of books to display in HTML table

### Other Experiences
-   Add your previous work experience (if any)
-   Do NOT include your Revature experience here; this is implied by the portfolio itself
-   You may include technical or non-technical experience
-   Fill in the required fields: Employer, dates, and job title. After saving the employment information, click on the blue-colored plus button to add the roles, responsibilities, and other necessary details.
-   If you want to mention your college projects apart from the Revature projects, fill the employer is your university and the job title as a student. After saving this information, click on the blue-colored plus button to add project details.

### Honors and Awards
- Include your honors/awards (if any)
- Examples may include scholarships, extracurricular achievements, or others

### Other 
- Avoid grammatical errors, typos, spelling mistakes, and wrong capitalization
