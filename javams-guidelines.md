Refer to the [Portfolio Guidelines](./javams-guidelines.md#portfolio-guidelines) and [Portfolio Samples](./javams-guidelines.md#portfolio-samples) to generate your portfolio through Revpro.

## Portfolio Guidelines
    
1.  Add **Job Title** as **Software Developer** or **Software Engineer** or **Full stack Software Developer**.

2.  **Industry equivalency** â€“ Add your top 5 key skills that are relevant to your core technology stack and the equivalency in months for each skill.
	- **Recommended Industry Equivalency Skills** - Java, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular 4+, Spring Framework, Spring Data, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Hibernate, JDBC, DevOps, Microservices, JUnit, and AWS.
	- All industry equivalencies should not be the same
	- **HTML**, **CSS**, **Agile**, and **Git** are not allowed.

3.  **Skills Matrix**
    -   This section used to mention the list of technologies/skills relevant to your core technology stack.
    -   Add a **minimum of 5 categories and 6 sub-skills each**.
    -   Equivalency for each skill must be between **3-24 months**.       
    -   It is mandatory to add **Microservices** as a category under the Skill Matrix.
    -   Check your capitalization of each technology or tool. Acronyms like AJAX or ORM should be in all caps, proper nouns like Java should be capitalized, compound words like DevOps should have each word capitalized, and normal words should not be capitalized. If you have a question about it, just google it and check before you submit it!

4.  **Projects**
    -   **Roles/Responsibilities** - Mention your Roles in the Project and add at least 8 bulleted responsibilities
        -   Talk about how you used different libraries, tools, and APIs (e.g. "Used the Collections framework and Stream API to store unique users and filter them by status")
        -   Include any metrics you have, like code coverage, code quality grades, build time, lines of code, etc ("Added unit tests to increase code coverage from 20% to 70%")
        -   Also, start your bullet points with the active past verbs ("built, created, implemented, etc...")
    -   **Project Repo URL** - Include **Github Repo Links** for your projects.
        -   Your Project Repo Should be **Public** and the Repo name should be your **Project Name**.
        -   Push your properly documented project code to the repo.
        -   Repo must have a **README file** with at least with - Title of the Project, An Explanation and Overview of the project, List of features implemented, Technologies used, How to set up / get started using it, Usage of the project, Contributors, and License information.
        -   You can have a look at the  [Sample README.md file template](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPorkodiVenkatesh%2FPROJECT-NAME&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFHkCy7oSKxn_nzSQVOx5YAqOqPDw) for your project documentation.
    -   **Make sure that the project order shows the most recent project to the least recent (P3, then P2, then P1)**
